# Wednesday Week36

[Slides for today](https://github.com/cpantea/Evolutionary_Thinking_2023/blob/main/week36/Wednesday/Week36_Wed.pdf)

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the MODELTEST paper and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### MODELTEST algorithm paper

You should read this paper before Monday class:

D Posada, K A Crandall, [MODELTEST: testing the model of DNA substitution](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/14.9.817)., Bioinformatics, Volume 14, Issue 9, 1998, Pages 817â€“818


Then, you are going to comment it in groups and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PE2yuAdapNSAZIzPYr7VewSzIq8TAQP5zHpx2gPt3rI). 

Odd-numbered groups will first address questions 1-6, while even-numbered groups should initially focus on 7-11.
